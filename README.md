# 3D realization
After receiving an image from a camera, a person's keypoints are extracted using a model, and the extracted points are moved to a virtual space.



Project Objectives
* The image is analyzed using a pretrained model in real time. Images are implemented in 3D in a virtual space.
* There is a safety issue in many industries. The goal is to solve people's safety before the incident with computer vision.
* It will be useful for people who want to know the posture and location of people using the video.(doctors, industrial managers, etc...)

# 3D realization
After receiving an image from a camera, a person's keypoints are extracted using a model, and the extracted points are moved to a virtual space.

1.Project Objectives
* The image is analyzed using a pretrained model in real time. Images are implemented in 3D in a virtual space.
* There is a safety issue in many industries. The goal is to solve people's safety before the incident with **computer vision**.
* It will be useful for people who want to know the posture and location of people using the video.(doctors, industrial managers, etc...)


2.project environment
This is my environment. You should use it according to your computer environment.
